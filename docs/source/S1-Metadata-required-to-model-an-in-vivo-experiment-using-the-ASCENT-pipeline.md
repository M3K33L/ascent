# Metadata required to model an in vivo experiment using the ASCENT pipeline

1.  Detailed specifications / dimensions of the stimulating cuff
    electrode.

2.  Transverse cross section of the nerve where the cuff is placed,
    stained to visualize the different tissue types (e.g., using
    Massonâ€™s trichrome), with a scale bar ([Fig 2](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009285.g002) and [S11 Text](S11-Morphology-files)) or known scale (micrometers/pixel). Different possible sources
    for defining the nerve sample morphology include:

    a.  For best specificity, the nerve would be sampled from the
        specific animal used in the experiment being modeled. In this
        case, two colors of tissue dye may be used on the ventral and
        medial aspects of the nerve to maintain orientation information.

    b.  Otherwise, a sample from another animal of the same species
        could be used at the correct nerve level.

    c.  If multiple samples from other animals are available, they could
        be used to generate a representative nerve model, knowing the
        range of morphological metrics across individuals using the
        `scripts/mock_morphology_generator.py` script ([S12 Text](S12-Python-MockSample-class-for-creating-binary-masks-of-nerve-morphology)).

    d.  Lastly, published data could be used.

3.  Orientation and rotation of the cuff on the nerve (e.g., cuff
    closure on the ventral side of the nerve).

4.  Fiber diameters

    a.  Distributions of fiber diameters may be obtained from
        literature; otherwise, detailed electromicroscopic studies are
        required.

    b.  The fiber diameters found in the target nerve that will be
        simulated in NEURON. All diameters or a subset of diameters may
        be of interest.

    c.  Each fiber diameter of interest can be simulated for each fiber
        location of interest, or specific fiber diameters can be
        simulated in specific locations.

5.  Approximate tissue or fluids surrounding the nerve and cuff (e.g.,
    muscle, fat, or saline).

6.  Stimulation waveforms, pulse widths, and other parameters of the
    electrical signal.

7.  If comparing to neural recordings: distance between the stimulation
    and recording cuffs.

8.  If comparing to functional recordings (e.g., EMG): distance from the
    stimulation cuff to the location where the nerve inserts into the
    muscle.
