# S31: NEURON launch.hoc
The ```launch.hoc``` file defines the parameters and simulation protocol for
modeling fiber response to electrical stimulation in NEURON and is
automatically populated based on parameters in ***Model*** and
***Sim***. The ```launch.hoc``` file is created by the ```HocWriter``` class.
Parameters defined in ```launch.hoc``` span the categories of: environment
(i.e., temperature from ***Model***), simulation time (i.e., time step,
duration of simulation from ***Sim***), fiber parameters (i.e., flags
for fiber geometry and channels, number of fiber nodes from ***Model***,
***Sim***, and ```config/system/fiber_z.json```), intracellular stimulation
(i.e., delay from start of simulation, amplitude, pulse duration, pulse
repetition frequency from ***Sim***), extracellular stimulation (i.e.,
path to waveform file in ```n_sim/``` folder which is always
```data/inputs/waveform.dat```), flags to define the model parameters that
should be recorded (i.e., Vm(t), Gating(t), Vm(x), Gating(x) from
***Sim***), the locations at which to record the parameters (nodes of
Ranvier for myelinated axons from ***Sim***), and parameters for the
binary search for thresholds (i.e., activation or block protocol,
initial upper and lower bounds on the stimulation amplitude for the
binary search, and threshold resolution for the binary search from
***Sim***). The ```launch.hoc``` file loads ```Wrapper.hoc``` which calls all NEURON
procedures. The ```launch.hoc``` file is created by the Python ```HocWriter```
class, which takes inputs of the ***Sim*** directory, ```n_sim/``` directory,
and an exception configuration. When the ```HocWriter``` class is
instantiated, it automatically loads the ```fiber_z.json``` configuration
file which contains all associated flags, parameters, and rules for
defining a fiberâ€™s geometry and channel mechanisms in NEURON.
